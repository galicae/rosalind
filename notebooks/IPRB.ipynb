    "Probability is the mathematical study of randomly occurring phenomena. We will model such a\n",
    "phenomenon with a random variable, which is simply a variable that can take a number of different\n",
    "distinct outcomes depending on the result of an underlying random process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say that we have a bag containing 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. If we let $X$ represent\n",
    " the random variable corresponding to the color of a drawn ball, then the probability of each of the\n",
    "two outcomes is given by $Pr(X=red)= \\frac{3}{5}$ and $Pr(X=blue)=\\frac{2}{5}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables can be combined to yield new random variables. Returning to the ball example, let\n",
    "$Y$ model the color of a second ball drawn from the bag (without replacing the first ball). The\n",
    "probability of Y Y being red depends on whether the first ball was red or blue. To represent all\n",
    "outcomes of $X$ and $Y$ , we therefore use a probability tree diagram. This branching diagram\n",
    "represents all possible individual probabilities for $X$ and $Y$, with outcomes at the endpoints\n",
    "(\"leaves\") of the tree. The probability of any outcome is given by the product of probabilities\n",
    "along the path from the beginning of the tree; see Figure 2 for an illustrative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "An event is simply a collection of outcomes. Because outcomes are distinct, the probability of an\n",
    "event can be written as the sum of the probabilities of its constituent outcomes. For our colored\n",
    " ball example, let $A$ be the event \"$Y$ is blue.\" $Pr(A)$ is equal to the sum of the probabilities\n",
    "of two different outcomes: $Pr(X=blue, Y=blue) + Pr(X=red, Y=blue)$, or\n",
    "$\\frac{3}{10}+\\frac{1}{10}=\\frac{2}{5}$\n",

    "Given: Three positive integers $k$, $m$, and $n$, representing a population containing $k+m+n$\n",
    "organisms: $k$ individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, $m$ are heterozygous, and $n$ are\n",
    "homozygous recessive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual\n",
    "possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two\n",
